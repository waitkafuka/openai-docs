# VitePress ðŸ’™ StackBlitz

Hi there :wave: This is a demo running VitePress within your **browser tab**!

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
$ npm install -D vitepress
```

```sh [pnpm]
$ pnpm add -D vitepress
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn add -D vitepress
```

::: details Getting missing peer deps warnings?
If using PNPM, you will notice a missing peer warning for `@docsearch/js`. This does not prevent VitePress from working. If you wish to suppress this warning, add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "peerDependencyRules": {
    "ignoreMissing": [
      "@algolia/client-search"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Powered by Vite

VitePress uses Vite under the hood. This means:

:::tip
By default, VitePress stores its dev server cache in `.vitepress/cache`, and the production build output in `.vitepress/dist`. If using Git, you should add them to your `.gitignore` file. These locations can also be [configured](/reference/site-config#outdir).

- Instant server start
- Lightning fast HMR
- Optimized builds
